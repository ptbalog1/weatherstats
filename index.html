                <p><span id="fact">The three ways precipitation can form are: frontally, orographically, and convectively. 
                    Frontal precipitation occurs when two masses of air meet. Orographic precipitation occurs when the shape of the land causes clouds to form. 
                    Convective precipitation is a result of clouds forming due to instability in the atmosphere.</span></p>
